# Analysis Result

The found problems found during the analysis are stored in two different formats.\

The first format is a machine readable format, which is stored in the file `results_machine.log`.
It is used to further process the results, mainly for the rewriting and replay of the trace.\

The second format is a human readable format, which is stored in the file `results_readable.log`
and printed to the terminal. It is used to show the results to the user.

This file explains the machine readable (results_machine.log) and the human
readable (result_readable.log) result file of the analysis.

## Machine readable result file

The result file contains all potential bugs found in the analyzed trace.\

The file contains one line for each found problem. The line consists of the
following elements:
```
line: [typeID],[args] | [typeId],[args],[args]
```
with
```
[args]: [arg] | [arg];[arg] | [arg];[arg];[arg] | ...
[arg] : T:[routineId]:[objId]:[tpre]:[objType]:[file]:[line] (trace element)
[arg] : S:[objId]:[objType] (select case)
```
The typeIDs have the following meaning:

- A1: Send on closed channel
- A2: Receive on closed channel
- A3: Close on closed channel
- A4: Concurrent recv
- A5: Select case without partner
- P1: Possible send on closed channel
- P2: Possible receive on closed channel
- P3: Possible negative waitgroup counter
- L1: Leak on unbuffered channel with possible partner
- L2: Leak on unbuffered channel without possible partner
- L3: Leak on buffered channel with possible partner
- L4: Leak on buffered channel without possible partner
- L5: Leak on nil channel
- L6: Leak on select with possible partner
- L7: Leak on select without possible partner (includes nil channels)
- L8: Leak on mutex
- L9: Leak on waitgroup
- L0: Leak on cond

<!--P4: Possible cyclic deadlock, disabled-->
<!--P5: Possible mixed deadlock, disabled-->
`[args]` shows the elements involved in the problem. There are either
one or two, while the args them self can contain multiple trace elements or select cases.\
The arg in args are separated by a semicolon.\
Each arg contains the following elements separated by a colon (:)
- `[routineId]` is the id of the routine that contains the operation
- `[objId]` is the id of the object that is involved in the operation
- `[tpre]` is the time of the operation
- `[opjType]` is the type of the element
  - Channel:
    - CS: send
    - CR: receive
    - CC: close
  - Mutex:
    - ML: Lock
    - MR: RLock
    - MT: TryLock
    - MY: TryRLock
    - MU: Unlock
    - MN: RUnlockfmt.Sprintf("T%d:%d:%d:%s:%s:%d", t.routineID, t.objID, t.tPre, t.objType, t.file, t.line)
  - Waitgroup:
    - WA: Add
    - WD: Done
    - WW: Wait
  - Select:
    - SS: Select
  - Cond:
    - NW: Wait
    - NB: Broadcast
    - NS: Signal
  - Once:
    - OE: Done Executed
    - ON: Done Not Executed (because the once was already executed)
  - Routine:
    - GF: Fork
- `[file]` is the file of the operation in the program code
- `[line]` is the line of the operation in the program code

## Human readable result file

The result file contains all potential bugs found in the analyzed trace.
A possible result would be:
```
Possible send on closed channel:
	close: example.go:10@47
	send: example.go:40@44
Possible receive on closed channel:
	close: example.go:10@47
	recv: example.go:20@43
Possible negative waitgroup counter:
	add: example.go:50@77;
	done: example.go:60@80;
```
Each found problem consist of three lines. The first line explains the
type of the found bug. The other two line contain the information about the
elements responsible for the problem. The elements always have the
form of
```
[type]: [file]:[line]@[tPre]
```


## Examples

The following examples show the different types of problems that can be found during the analysis.

### Send on close
A send on closed is an actual send on a closed channel (always leads to panic).
The two args of this case are:

- the send operation
- the close operation

An example for a send on closed is:
```golang
1 func main() {          // routine = 1
2 	c := make(chan int)  // objId = 2
3 	close(c)             // tPre = 10
4 	c <- 1               // tPre = 12
5 }
```


In the machine readable format, the send on closed has the following form:
```
A1,T:1:2:12:CS:example.go:4;,T:1:2:10:CC:example.go:3
```
In the human readable format, the send on closed has the following form:
```
Found receive on closed channel:
	send: example.go:4@12
	close: example.go:5@10
```


### Receive on close
A receive on closed is an actual receive on a closed channel.
The two args of this case are:

- the receive operation
- the close operation

An example for a receive on closed is:
```golang
1 func main() {          // routine = 1
2   c := make(chan int)  // objId = 2
3   close(c)             // tPre = 10
4   <-c                  // tPre = 12
5 }
```

In the machine readable format, the receive on closed has the following form:
```
A2,T:1:2:12:CR:example.go:4,T:1:2:10:CC:example.go:3
```

In the human readable format, the receive on closed has the following form:
```
Found receive on closed channel:
	recv: example.go:4@12
	close: example.go:5@10
```

### Close on close
A send on closed is an actual close on a closed channel (always leads to panic).
The two args of this case are:

- the close operation that leads to the panic
- the close operation that is the first close on the channel

An example for a close on closed is:
```golang
1 func main() {          // routine = 1
2   c := make(chan int)  // objId = 2
3   close(c)             // tPre = 10
4   close(c)             // tPre = 12
5 }
```


In the machine readable format, the close on closed has the following form:
```
A3,T:1:2:12:CC:example.go:4;,T:1:2:10:CC:example.go:3
```

In the human readable format, the close on closed has the following form:
```
Found close on closed channel:
	close: example.go:4@12
	close: example.go:3@10
```

### Concurrent recv
A concurrent recv shows two receive operations on the same channel that are concurrent.:
The two args of this case are:

- the recv operation
- the recv operation

An example for a concurrent recv is:
```golang
 1 func main() {           // routine = 1
 2   c := make(chan int)   // objId = 2
 3
 4   go func() {           // routine = 2
 5     <-c                 // tPre = 10
 6   }()
 7
 8   go func() {           // routine = 3
 9     <-c                 // tPre = 20
10   }()
11
12   c <- 1                // tPre = 30
10 }
```

The machine readable format of the concurrent recv has the following form:
```
A4,T:3:2:20:CR:example.go:9;,T:4:2:10:CR:example.go:5
```
The human readable format of the concurrent recv has the following form:
```
Found concurrent Recv on same channel:
	recv: example.go:9@20
	recv: example.go:5@10
```

### Select case without partner or nil case
A select case without partner shows a select case that is missing a partner or is a nil case.
The two args of this case are:

- the select operation
- the select case without partner

The select case consists of the channel number and the direction (S: send, R: recv). If the channel is nil, the channel number is -1.

The following example shows a select case without partner (d) and a nil case (e):
```golang
 1 func main() {          // routine = 1
 2   c := make(chan int)  // objId = 2
 3   d := make(chan int)  // objId = 3
 4   e := make(chan int)  // objId = 4
 5
 6   e = nil
 3
 4   go func() {          // routine = 2
 5     c <- 1             // objID = 2, tPre = 8
 6   }()
 7
 8   select {             // objID = 5, tPre = 10
 9   case <-c:
10   case <-d:            // no partner
11   case e <- 1:         // nil
12  }
13 }
```

The machine readable format of the select case without partner or nil case has the following form:
```
A5,T:1:5:10:SS:example.go:8,S:3:CR      // select case without partner
A5,T:1:5:10:SS:example.go:8,S:-1:CS     // nil case
```

The human readable format of the select case without partner or nil case has the following form:
```
Possible select case without partner or nil case:    // select case without partner
	select: example.go:8@10
	case: 3,R
Possible select case without partner or nil case:    // nil case
	select: example.go:8@10
	case: -1,R
```
